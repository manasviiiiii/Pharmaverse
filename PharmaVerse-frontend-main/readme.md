## 🛠️ Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites  

Before setting up the project, ensure you have:  

- **[Node.js (v16 or later)](https://nodejs.org/)** – Required for running the frontend.  
- **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)** – To connect with the **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet**.  
- **PharmaVerse Smart Contracts** – Already deployed on **Sepolia Testnet**.  
- **Alchemy or Infura API Key** – For blockchain RPC access.  

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository  

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pharmaverse-frontend.git
 cd pharmaverse-frontend
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies  

```sh
 npm install
```

---

### 4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables  

Create a **.env** file in the project root and add the required keys:  

```sh
 REACT_APP_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=<your_rpc_provider_url>
 REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your_smart_contract_address>
 REACT_APP_AI_CHATBOT_API=<your_google_ai_studio_api_key>
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run the Application  

Start the development server:  

```sh
 npm start
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.  

---

## 🔄 Deployment  

To deploy the frontend, first build the application:  

```sh
 npm run build
```

Then, **upload the generated `build/` folder** to any hosting platform such as:  

- **Vercel** – [Deploy Here](https://vercel.com/)  
- **Netlify** – [Deploy Here](https://www.netlify.com/)  
- **Firebase Hosting** – [Deploy Here](https://firebase.google.com/)  

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations  

- **API keys and sensitive data should NEVER be committed to GitHub**.  
- **Use HTTPS** to encrypt communications and protect user data.  
- **Ensure MetaMask permissions are properly managed** to prevent unauthorized blockchain transactions.  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is implemented to restrict unauthorized actions.
